##‚ú® Features
1. Geolocation-Based Auto-Loading (On Load)
Automatic Detection: Uses the browser's Geolocation API to instantly detect the user's latitude and longitude upon page load.

Instant Data: Fetches and displays current weather and forecast data for the user's precise location without requiring any input.

Fallback: If the user denies location permission or the browser does not support Geolocation, the app defaults to showing weather for a major city (e.g., London) and notifies the user.

2. Comprehensive Current Weather Display
Location & Date: Displays the city name, country, and the current date/day.

Core Metrics: Shows the main temperature, accompanied by a dynamic weather icon representing current conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).
